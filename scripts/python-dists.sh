# Build, smoke-test, or publish the `quip-signer` Python distribution. Single
# source of truth for the build/smoke/upload commands so the CI jobs that touch
# them don't drift -- changing the artefact matrix, the smoke check, or the
# upload flow is a one-place edit here.
#
# quip-signer is a single PyO3 abi3 cdylib (mixed maturin layout: the Rust
# extension is dropped into the `quip_signer` package under the crate's
# in-tree `python/` python-source).
# There are no pure-Python peer packages and the crate itself is
# `publish = false`, so -- unlike xquad's multi-package python-dists.sh -- this
# handles exactly one distribution and mints exactly one OIDC token.
#
# The three modes map one-to-one onto separate CI jobs. They are split (rather
# than one build-and-publish job) so the cross-built aarch64 wheel is import-
# tested on a NATIVE arm64 runner before any upload: a wheel only imports on its
# own architecture, so a single amd64 job physically cannot exercise both. The
# build job produces dist/ once; two smoke jobs (amd64 + aarch64) each import
# their arch's wheel; publish uploads the exact bytes that passed both smokes.
#
# Modes:
#   build
#       maturin build (abi3 wheels: linux x86_64 native + linux aarch64 via
#       cargo-zigbuild) + maturin sdist, then the metadata/content guards
#       (manylinux platform tag, packed python surface, `twine check`). No
#       import, no network, no token. dist/ is the CI artefact the smoke and
#       publish jobs consume. Runs on every MR/push (dry-run) and before a
#       tagged publish.
#
#   smoke
#       Install the one wheel matching THIS runner's platform tag into a
#       throwaway venv and import + round-trip sign/verify. Run once per arch
#       (amd64 + aarch64 runners) so every shipped wheel -- including the cross-
#       built aarch64 one -- is exercised on its own architecture before upload.
#       Consumes dist/ from the build job; builds nothing.
#
#   publish <testpypi|pypi>
#       Exchange the GitLab OIDC JWT in PYPI_ID_TOKEN for a short-lived API
#       token at the target registry's mint endpoint and `twine upload` the
#       prebuilt dist/. Requires PYPI_ID_TOKEN in env (set by the job's
#       `id_tokens` block in .gitlab-ci.yml). Gated in CI on both smoke jobs
#       passing. Used by release:publish-testpypi (auto) and release:publish-pypi
#       (manual) on release tags.
#
# Run from the workspace root.
